# Speech-to-Mail

Simple app, which uses DeepL and ChatGPT to turn your raw audio input into the properly formatted email. There are also some extra options available to play with, such as generating some different types, like code or poem.

The app uses [Tectalic OpenAI REST API Client](https://github.com/tectalichq/public-openai-client-php) and [deepl-php](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-php) to communicate with the APIs. You will need the API Keys for both DeepL and ChatGPT to use this app. You can get them for free, but you will need to register on their websites.
